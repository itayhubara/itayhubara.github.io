I am Itay Hubara, a PhD graduate from the Technion - Israel Institute of Technology. I have more than 10 years of experience with deep learning. My research interests include binarized neural networks, quantized neural networks, model compression, large batch training and hardware-software co-design. I have published over 20 papers in top-tier conferences and journals, such as NeurIPS, ICML, CVPR, ICLR, and JMLR. I have also contributed to several open-source projects on GitHub. Currently, I am a principal engineer, tech lead and senior researcher at Intel-habanalabs, a company that develops world-class AI processors for the data center. As part of my work I contributed to MLPerf inference and training benchmarks, a a standard for measuring the performance of machine learning systems and serves as Habana's MLCommon representative. 

Diving into the world of deep learning and technology, I am genuinely captivated by the ever-changing landscape and the endless possibilities it holds. My professional journey is marked by a steadfast commitment to staying updated on advancements and making meaningful contributions to the future of these fields. I am always open for collaborations and searching for exciting new technologies and adventures in the field of artificial intelligence.
